# Celonis Purchase-to-Pay Process Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using Celonis, a leading process mining tool. The P2P process covers the entire journey of procurement, from purchase orders to payments. The goal is to improve the efficiency of the P2P process and reduce delays in the procurement cycle.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes various transactional data points related to purchase orders, materials, and order execution. Key columns in the dataset include:

- **Purchasing Document**: Unique identifier for each procurement transaction.
- **Item**: Specific item being purchased.
- **Item Category Text (EKPO_PSTYP)**: Classification of items into categories.
- **Material Group Text (MATKL_TEXT)**: Grouping of materials.
- **Net Value (NETWR_EUR)**: Monetary value of the purchase order in euros.
- **Case ID**: Unique identifier for each procurement case.
- **Number of Activities**: Count of activities associated with each case.
- **Order Quantity**: Quantity of the items ordered.
- **Net Order Price**: Price per item in the order.
- **Net Order Value**: Total value of the purchase order.
- **No. Rem./Expedit**: Number of reminders for overdue items.
- **Duration**: Time taken for the procurement activities.

## Tools and Methodologies
1. **Celonis Process Mining Platform**: Used to visualize the flow of procurement activities and identify inefficiencies.
2. **Process Visualization**: Highlighted bottlenecks and delays in specific activities.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Analyzed key performance indicators like lead time and compliance rates.

## Project Insights
- Key bottlenecks were identified in the order approval and delivery stages.
- Higher-value orders experienced more complex approval processes.
- Suggested enhancements to automate low-value order workflows to improve efficiency.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional data sources for comprehensive analysis.
- Explore predictive analytics to forecast delays in the procurement process.

## Technologies Used
- Celonis Process Mining
- Excel/CSV for data manipulation
